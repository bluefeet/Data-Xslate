Revision history for Perl extension Data::Xslate.

{{$NEXT}}

 - Stop modifying the passed in data structure, and add a test
   which verifies this.

0.02 2016-10-04

 - Fixed a bunch of nasty little bugs found by creating a new test
   which checks permutations of nested_key_tag, substitution_tag,
   and key_separator.
 - Changed the default nested_key_tag and substitution_tag to
   a plane old equals sign.  This may not work great in all situations,
   but its simple and easy to change.
 - Add a key_separator argument so the character used between
   keys in a key path can be customized.
 - Make the nested keys syntax more explicit by supporting a
   nested_key_tag argument.
 - Stop CPAN from indexing an internal package.
 - Add Text::Xslate to dependencies.
